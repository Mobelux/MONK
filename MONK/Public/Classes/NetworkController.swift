If you are wanting a `DownloadTask` that can keep running when your app is backgrounded, you use `.background(withIdentifier:)` or `.mobeluxBackground(withIdentifier:)`

        - parameter delegate:       An optional delegate that can recieve some basic notifications about metrics and things.

You really shouldn't care which one is used under the hood, but the rule is that if you have a `Request` who's `httpMethod` has a `bodyData`, then a `URLSessionUploadTask` will be used. This way you can get upload progress and other niceties that `URLSessionUploadTask` provides.
