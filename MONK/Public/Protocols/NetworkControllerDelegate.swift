     - discussion: In iOS, when a background transfer completes or requires credentials, if your app is no longer running, your app is automatically relaunched in the background, and the app’s `UIApplicationDelegate` is sent an `application(_:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:)` message. This call contains the identifier of the session that caused your app to be launched. Your app should then store that completion handler before creating a background configuration object with the same identifier, and creating a session with that configuration. The newly created session is automatically reassociated with ongoing background activity.
     
        When your app later receives this `networkControllerDidFinishAllEvents` message, this indicates that all messages previously enqueued for this controller have been delivered, and that it is now safe to invoke the previously stored completion handler or to begin any internal updates that may result in invoking the completion handler. This call will happen on the main queue, since you should invoke the completeion handler on the main queue.
     
        This won't be called if the application is in the forground when the network controller finishes, or if you don't create a background `NetworkController` using the same identifier as the original one that started the request.
